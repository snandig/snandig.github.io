Objectives & Topics:
====================
Busy lifestyles, abundant options, lack of knowledge ... there are many reasons why 
people make poor decisions relating to their health. Yet these poor decisions are leading 
to epidemics, which represent some of the greatest challenges we face as a society today. 
Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs), which include cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic 
respiratory diseases and diabetes, account for ∼60% of total deaths worldwide. 
These diseases share the same four behavioural risk factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, 
physical inactivity and harmful consumption of alcohol and can be prevented and sometimes 
even reversed with simple lifestyle changes. Eating more healthily, exercising more appropriately, 
sleeping and relaxing more, as well as simply being more aware of one’s state of health are all 
things that would lead to improved health. Yet knowing exactly what to change and how, 
implementing changes and maintaining changes over long time periods are all things people 
find challenging. These are also problems, for which we believe recommender systems can provide 
assistance by offering specific, tailored suggestions for behavioural change. 
In recent years recommender systems for health has become a popular topic within the RecSys 
community and a selection of empirical contributions and demo systems have been published. 
Efforts to date, however have been sporadic and lack coordination. We lack shared infrastructure 
such as datasets, appropriate cross-disciplinary knowledge, even agreed upon goals. 

It is our aim to use this workshop as a vehicle to:

** Establish the problem as a prominent RecSys topic
** Create a community of researchers who will determine a concrete research agenda for health in RecSys
** Attract scientists from other domains to RecSys: health (e.g. sports, nutrition, medicine), psychology, signal processing, wearables, HCI, etc.
** Create new ideas for collaboration, particularly cross-domain collaborations
** Establish shared infrastructure (datasets and tools)

We invite submissions that may include the following topics, but are not limited to:

** Motivation - increasing motivation, understanding motivation, utilising psychological models, gamification
** Algorithms for Health Recommendations
** Interfaces - Explanations/Presentation, Feedback, Usability
** Persuasive Design
** Sensors - e.g. activity tracking, context detection, quantified self, motivation by self assessment
** Mobile devices
** Gamification - e.g. Making exercise or diet fun
** Social Motivation - Inclusion of Social Context, Coactivity and Group Recommenders
** Knowledge representation - Transfer of domain knowledge to digital systems
** Ethics - Gap between recommendations and medical advice
** Ease of use - embedding systems into everyday life Learning about health
** User modelling, behavioural analytics and behavioural change

Submissions: 
============
We solicit short research papers (up to 4 pages) & short postion papers (up to 2 pages), both in the ACM conference paper style. 
Papers should be submitted in EasyChair to https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=healthrecsys2016

Submission guidelines: 
======================
All submitted papers must be written in English;
* contain author names, affiliations, and email addresses;
* be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings template (http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) with a font size no smaller than 9pt;
* be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any platform), and formatted for US Letter size;

All papers will be peer-reviewed, must not be under review in any other conference, workshop or journal (at the time of submission), 
and must contain novel contributions. Accepted papers will be published according to the ACM RECSYS 2016 WS publication rules.

Location:
=========
The workshop will take place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) or the IBM Research campuses in Boston, MA, USA (venue not fixed yet) 
and will be held in conjunction with the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. 
Further information of this location can be found on the ACM RecSys website: https://recsys.acm.org/.
