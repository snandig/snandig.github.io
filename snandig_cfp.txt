Objectives & Topics:
====================
We invite original submissions addressing all aspects of social networks analysis and digital humanities. Online social networks and social media sites allow numerous users to participate in collaboratively creating online information by producing new content and establishing new links between people, information, and services. Users participating in such online endeavours leave digital traces on the Web, which provides unparalleled research opportunities for studying questions in sociology, psychology, behavioral science, or political and economic science. While studying human digital traces have received attention from different communities, understanding human social behavior via non-invasive methods remains a challenging task and an open problem. Tackling these challenges requires the development of new methods, instruments and techniques as well as an interdisciplinary effort from researchers across disciplines such as computer science, humanities, social sciences and others. This workshop seeks original submissions on either methods or practices at the crossroads of these various disciplines.

We invite submissions that may include the following topics, but are not limited to:

** Studies of online communities
** Community of practice, online participation
** Graph partitioning and community discovery
** Link prediction
** Location-aware social networks and mobility
** Expertise and trust in online social networks
** Crowdsourcing and social media
** Information diffusion in social networks
** Social influence
** Studies of human culture based on online social networks and encyclopedia, computational methods to assess human culture along different dimensions (such as language, food, music, literature etc.)
** Using social media to study psychological and social phenomena, and corresponding methods to assess such phenomena via web-based investigations
** Biases in social media, such as population biases, channel bias, self-selection bias, etc and computational methods for assessment and correction
** The study of limitations of tools used in digital humanities, extension of traditional source criticism into the development of systematic "tool criticism"
** Social and individual inequalities on the web, e.g. gender or race disparities, computational methods and instruments to assess and track inequalities
** Studies of political processes and dynamics on the web, such as elections, political unrest, grassroots movements
** Predictions with social media, e.g. stock markets, spread of language, culture, memes or diseases
** Longitudinal studies of social phenomena and social change on the web
** Computational methods to assess and improve social and/or individual well-being via the web
** Studies investigating the role and causal impact of algorithms in facilitating social interactions on the web


Submissions: 
============
Submissions: We solicit research papers (max. 8 pages) in the ACM conference paper style. Acceptance of the papers will be either as full (regular) or short/demo papers with the corresponding presentation slots. Papers accepted as full will be published in the ACM Digital Library and papers accepted as short/demo will be published in special online workshop proceedings. Papers should be submitted in EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iknow2017. Please select "Social Network Analysis" as a track in EasyChair. 

Submission guidelines:

* be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any platform), and formatted for US Letter size;

All papers will be peer-reviewed, must not be under review in any other conference, workshop or journal (at the time of submission), 
and must contain novel contributions.

Location:
=========
The workshop will take place at the Messe Congress Graz, Austria and will be held in conjunction with the International Workshop on Social Network Analysis and Digital Humanities.
