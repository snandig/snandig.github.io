Objectives & Topics:
====================
We invite original submissions addressing all aspects of social networks and digital humanities. 
Social networks and social media allow numerous users to participate in production and consumption of 
online information by establishing new links between people, information, and services. 
Users participating in such online endeavours leave digital traces on the Web, which provides unparalleled 
research opportunities for studying questions in sociology, psychology, behavioral science, 
political and economic science, and many others. While studying human digital traces have 
received attention from different communities, understanding human social behavior via unobtrusive methods 
(i.e. methods where the researcher doesnâ€™t intrude into the research context) remains a challenging endeavor 
and an open problem. Tackling these challenges requires the development of new methods, instruments and techniques 
as well as an interdisciplinary effort from researchers across disciplines such as computer science, humanities, social sciences and others. 
This workshop seeks original submissions on either methods or practices at the crossroads of these various disciplines.

We invite submissions that may include the following topics, but are not limited to:

** Studies of online communities and their behavior
** Community of practice, online participation
** Centrality and ranking in social networks
** Graph partitioning and community discovery
** Link prediction
** Location-aware social networks and mobility
** Expertise and trust in online social networks
** New models and algorithms for social network analysis
** Crowdsourcing and social media
** Information diffusion in social networks
** Social influence
** Studies of human culture based on online social networks and encyclopedia, computational methods to assess human culture along different dimensions (such as language, food, music, literature etc.)
** Using social media to study psychological and social phenomena, and corresponding methods to assess such phenomena via web-based investigations
** Biases in social media, such as population biases, channel bias, self-selection bias, etc and computational methods for assessment and correction
** The study of limitations of tools used in digital humanities, extension of traditional source criticism into the development of systematic "tool criticism"
** Social and individual inequalities on the web, e.g. gender or race disparities, computational methods and instruments to assess and track inequalities
** Studies of political processes and dynamics on the web, such as elections, political unrest, grassroots movements
** Predictions with social media, e.g. stock markets, spread of language, culture, memes or diseases
** Longitudinal studies of social phenomena and social change on the web
** Computational methods to assess and improve social and/or individual well-being via the web
** Studies investigating the role and causal impact of algorithms in facilitating social interactions on the web

Submissions: 
============
We solicit short research papers (up to 4 pages) & short postion papers (up to 2 pages), both in the ACM conference paper style.
